<section id='abstract'>

<p>This document provides a recommendation for how UAs should manage access to
permissions in applications built from cross-origin components. Namely, it is
recommended that UAs only allow permissions to be given to embedded applications
via delegation from the embedding application.</p>

<p>A web platform API for delegating permissions to embedded applications is
also described. This API allows a web application to explicitly delegate and un-
delegate permissions that it holds to cross-origin embedded applications. It
also allows a web application to query the status of delegation to an embedded
application.</p>

<section>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>An <dfn>embedder</dfn> is a frame that includes another frame (the
<dfn>embedee</dfn>). For example, a top-level document that includes an iframe
is embedding that iframe.</p>

<p>An embedder can <dfn>delegate</dfn> permissions it holds to its embedee(s),
thus allowing the embedee to use the powerful feature to which the permission
grants access. Similarly, an embedder can <dfn>undelegate</dfn> (revoke) a
permission from an embedee.</p>

<p>Applications built from an embedder and 1 or more embedees from different
origins are <dfn>composed applications</dfn>.</p>

</section>

<section class='informative'>

<h2>Background and Motivations</h2>

<p>Web applications are able to request permissions, such as geolocation, using
various APIs on the web platform. In many UAs these permission requests will
trigger prompts to the user. The user can make a decision about whether to allow
access to the permission to the requesting origin. In many UAs these user
decisions will also be persisted, such that the user will not have to make a
decision for subsequent access requests.</p>

<p>Web applications are composable: one web application (the embedder) can embed
others (embedees) by using the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> HTML tag. If a
cross-origin embedee request permissions, it can be problematic from the
perspective of both the user and the embedder. There are 4 reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    People don’t have a good understanding of permission requests from embedees.
    There is often no UI in the UA indicating that embedees are present or what
    their origin is. They may even be invisible on a page. The concept of
    composable applications is not a simple one to convey. The results of a user
    study [[iframe-permissions-study]] showed that participants were generally
    confused about who they were granting access to when a permission request
    came from an embedee.
  </li>
  <li>
    It’s unclear how a UA should persist the permission decisions people make
    for composed applications. Different UAs persist people’s decisions about
    embedees in different ways. Some UAs associate the permission grant to the
    combination of the embedder’s origin and the embedee’s origin, such that the
    UA recalls the decision about the embedee’s permissions only when embedded
    in that same embedder. Other UAs associate the grant only to the requesting
    origin, regardless of whether and where it is embedded. Either mechanism is
    likely to violate people’s expectations, at least some of the time. The
    inconsistency across — and even within — UAs further exacerbates the
    problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    It’s difficult to build understandable permission management UI. This is
    particularly true if UAs persist decisions to a combination of the
    embedder’s and embedee’s origin. UI surfaces such as those for revocation
    and auditing must cope with displaying two origins in a way that people can
    understand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Embedders have no way to regulate access to their embedees. This means that
    embedees can behave in ways that reflect badly on the embedder.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>To address these issues, we recommend that UAs require embedders to
explicitly delegate permissions to embedees, rather than allow embeddees to
unilaterally use or request to use powerful features. <dfn>Delegation</dfn>
is the ability for an origin running in one frame to share a permission
grant with an embedded, cross-origin frame. People would only ever be
required to make permission decisions about the <em>apparent</em> origin of
the application: that of the top-level embedder. The benefits of this, with
relation to the above problems, are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The user does not need to understand the nature of composable web
    applications because they only ever make decisions about the top-level
    origin.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is clear how to persist user decisions: they are only ever stored for the
    top-level origin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because decisions are only ever made about the top-level origin, it is much
    easier to build permission management UI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because embedees cannot gain access on their own, embedders are able to
    police their embedders.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Note that there is a necessary trade-off between scoping permission
grants in as fine-grained a manner as possible versus scoping permission
grants at a level of granularity that people can understand. See <a
href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>.</p>

<p>Permission delegation is already possible on the web platform. For
example, if a person has granted Geolocation to an origin in a frame, the
origin can expose Geolocation data to other, cross-origin frames via
<code>postMessage</code> (among other mechanisms). This document describes a
new web platform API that enables embedders to delegate permissions in a way
that the UA can effectively mediate on behalf of users. In addition to
delegating access, the API also exposes means to revoke and query delegated
access. We intend for the API to be convenient to invoke and to afford
efficient implementations.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Permission Restrictions for Embedded Web Applications</h2>

<p>Cross-origin embedded applications SHOULD only be able to acquire permission
grants by explicit delegation from the embedder using the API described in the
section below. In cases where an embedder has chosen not to delegate a
permission, the embedee SHOULD NOT be able to trigger permission prompts to the
user and the embedee SHOULD NOT be able to acquire permission based on a prior
decision made by the user.</p>

<p>UAs MAY allow cross-origin embedded applications to acquire permission grants
through the use of advanced user configurations, such as custom whitelists.</p>

<p>The above requirements do not apply to permissions that are granted to
service workers as these can trivially be accessed from embedded
applications.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Delegating Permissions</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways for an embedder to delegate permission grants to an embedee:
A declarative syntax in the HTML tag that instantiates the embedee; and an
imperative syntax that extends the <a>Permissions interface</a>. These are
described below.</p>

<p>Once a permission has been delegated to an embedee, the embedee must have
access to use the permission as long as the following requirements are met:
  <ol>
    <li>The embedder and embedee meet the minimum security requirements to ask
    for the permission in the first place. Currently this requires that both
    embedder and embedee be running in a <a>privileged context</a>.</li>
    <li>The embedder itself has access to the permission.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>The lifetime of the embedees access to the permission must be tied to the
lifetime of the embedders access to the permission. That is, the embedee will
only get access to the permission when the embedder has access and will lose
access if the embedder loses access.</p>

<p>Note that an embedder must still be able to ask for a permission to be
delegated even before it has access to use the permission itself. In cases like
this, a request to use the permission by the embedee may trigger an automatic
request to use the permission by the embedder. This allows embedees to get
access to permissions without embedders having to get access up front.</p>

<p>If an embedee performs a cross-origin navigation the permission must be
implicitly un-delegated and the embedee will lose access. This prevents
unintentionally delegating access to other origins.</p>

<section>

<h3>Delegation via the Declarative API</h3>

The permissions attribute is defined on the <a>iframe element<a>.

<pre class='idl'>
interface HTMLIFrameElement : HTMLElement {
  [PutForwards=value] readonly attribute DOMSettableTokenList permissions;
};
</pre>

<p>The permissions attribute, when specified, will delegate the given set of
permissions to the embedee running in the iframe. Its value must be an unordered
set of unique space-separated tokens that are ASCII case-insensitive. The
allowed values are the permission names that come from the <a>PermissionName
enum</a>.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Delegation via the Imperative API</h3>

<p>The <a>Permissions interface</a> is extended to provide functions for
delegating and undelegating permissions as well as querying the delegation
status.</p>

<pre class='idl'>
  [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
  interface Permissions {
    Promise delegate((PermissionDescriptor or sequence&lt;PermissionDescriptor&gt;) permission);
    Promise undelegate((PermissionDescriptor or sequence&lt;PermissionDescriptor&gt;) permission);
    Promise&lt;boolean&gt; isDelegated(PermissionDescriptor permission);
  };
</pre>

<p>When called with these functions <a>PermissionDescriptor</a> must contain a
field which specifies the embedee:</p>

<dl class='idl' title='dictionary PermissionDescriptor'>
  <dt>
    required PermissionName <a>name</a>
  </dt>
  <dt>
    HTMLIframeElement embedee
  </dt>
</dl>

<p>The embedee must be nested in the caller’s browsing context.</p>

<p>Calling delegate will cause the given permissions to be delegated to their
embedees. The promise returned will resolve if the permission is successfully
delegated, otherwise it will be rejected. Similarly, undelegate will cause the
given permissions to no longer be delegated to their embedees.</p>

<p>The isDelegated function returns a promise which will resolve to true if the
permission is delegated to the given frame or to false otherwise.</p>

</section>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Consider an embedder https://restaurant.example.net whose developers want to
show a map on the page that enables people to get directions to the restaurant.
They can do so by instantiating an iframe to the maps service
https://maps.example.com, and by explicitly delegating the
<var>geolocation</var> permission:

<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/" permissions="geolocation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

<p>Consider next that the developers of https://restaurant.example.net learn of
a new feature that https://maps.example.com provides, which is to send people
notifications when it’s time to leave to get to their destination on time. For
example, people may want to know not just the directions to the restaurant, but
also to be notified when they should leave to make it by the time their
reservation starts. The developers would explicitly grant the embedded iframe a
second permission, <var>notifications</var>:</p>

<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/" permissions="geolocation notifications"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

Delegation via the imperative API:

<pre class='example highlight'>
var iframe = document.getElementById('embedee');
navigator.permissions.delegate({embedee: iframe, name: 'geolocation'}).then(
  function() {
    // Delegated geolocation
  }).catch(function() {
    // Did not delegate geolocation
  });
</pre>

Undelegating permissions:

<pre class='example highlight'>
var iframe = document.getElementById('embedee');
navigator.permissions.undelegate({embedee: iframe, name: 'geolocation'});
</pre>

Checking whether permission is delegated:

<pre class='example highlight'>
var iframe = document.getElementById('embedee');
navigator.permissions.isDelegated({embedee: iframe, name: 'geolocation'})
  .then(function(result) {
    // result === true
  });
</pre>

</section>

<section class='informative'>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

TODO: expand this to argue the transfer of the trust decision from the user to
the embedder and tie into the section below.

<h3>Breaks Principle Of Least Privilege</h3>

<p>The obvious downside of this proposal is that an iframe can’t get access to a
permission without the top level frame also getting access to the permission.
For example, currently when purchasing an airline ticket on the British Airways
website with an AMEX credit card, an iframe navigated to the AMEX site may ask
for your location in order to verify your purchase. Under this proposal, the
user would have to give access to their location to British Airways as well as
AMEX instead of just AMEX. Note that the decision would only be persisted for
British Airways.</p>

<p>We could extend this scenario to a potentially more problematic case where a
less trustworthy site, such as https://suspicious.com also allows purchases and
embeds an AMEX frame for credit card verification. Now the user has to give
access to their location to https://suspicious.com as well as AMEX to complete
their purchase which obviously is not ideal. </p>

<p>On the flip side, in the current situation where iframes are allowed to
request location directly, https://suspicious.com can pretend to embed AMEX and
try to phish the user’s location access (note that there may be other ways to
mitigate this risk as well).</p>

</section>

<section class='informative'>

<h2>Other Risks</h2>

<section>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>This document specifies breaking changes to the web platform. Namely,
embedees that were once able to request and acquire permissions will no longer
be able to do so. In order to restore functionality, embedders need to change
their iframe tags to specify which permissions they wish to delegate. Usage of
permissions from embedees is currently very low (see
[[iframe-permissions-chrome]]), so the impact of this change should be small. It
is recommended that UAs communicate this change with developers prior to
implemenation in order to minimize the impact of the change. This can be done
through the use of console warning messages or other channels.</p>

<p>The upside of this breakage is that any harmful or annoying permission
requests from embedees, which website owners did not intend their users to be
exposed to will be prevented.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the restrictions specified in this document
would prevent secure (HTTPS) embedees in non-secure (HTTP) embedders from
getting access to permissions. The reason is that the availability of “powerful
features” on non-secure origins is being phased out (see [[powerful-features]]).
This means that a top level HTTP web application would never be able to access a
permission in order to delegate it. This is actually not more restrictive than
what is specified in [[powerful-features]], which requires all ancestor frames
be secure in order for a frame to be considered secure. The restrictions
specified in this document would not result in additional breakages.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Changing Embedee Permissions</h3>

<p>iframe tags tend to be fairly widely copy/pasted. For example, to make it
easy for developers to embed YouTube videos, YouTube provides a HTML iframe
snippet which can be pasted into a website. Once these snippets have been
deployed, it is hard for embedees to have them changed. For example, if the
permissions required to run YouTube ever changed, it would be impossible for
YouTube to update all of its embedders. While this may be problematic for
embedees, it gives embedders an opportunity to decide whether they really want
the embedee to have access to the permission.</p>
