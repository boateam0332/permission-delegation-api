<section id='abstract'>

<p>This document proposes a recommendation for how UAs should manage access to
permissions in applications built from cross-origin components. We recommend
that UAs only allow permissions to be granted to embedded applications via
explicit delegation from the embedding application.</p>

<p>We describe a web platform API for delegating permissions to embedded
applications. This API allows a web application to explicitly delegate and
un-delegate permissions that it holds to cross-origin embedded applications. It
also allows a web application to query the status of delegation to an embedded
application.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>A <dfn>powerful feature</dfn> is a web platform feature or API that allows an
origin to have access to information the user may consider security- or
privacy-sensitive, or access to pwoerful sensors on the platform the UA runs on,
such as the camera or microphone.</p>

<p>A <dfn>permission</dfn>, generally, is an affordance in the UA to allow,
deny, throttle, or otherwise regulate access to a powerful feature that the
user, through the UA, may grant to the web origin. Examples of powerful features
include [[geolocation-API]] and the <code>getUserMedia</code> API from
[[webrtc]].</p>

<p>An <dfn>embedder</dfn> is a <a>Document</a> that includes a <a>nested
browsing context</a>. An <dfn>embedee</dfn> is a Document contained
within the nested browsing context of an embedder. Typically, an embedder would
include an embedee using an <a>iframe element</a>. A <dfn>top-level
embedder</dfn> is an embedder loaded in a <a>top-level browsing context</a>.</p>

<p>An embedder can <dfn>delegate</dfn> permissions it holds to its embedee(s),
thus allowing the embedee to use the powerful feature to which the permission
grants access. Similarly, an embedder can <dfn>undelegate</dfn> (revoke) a
permission from an embedee.</p>

<p>Applications built from an embedder and 1 or more embedees from different
origins are <dfn>composed applications</dfn>.</p>

</section>

<section class='informative'>

<h2>Background And Motivations</h2>

<p>Web applications are able to request permissions, such as geolocation, using
various APIs on the web platform. Many UAs will defer the decision to the user,
prompting the user to make a decision about the permission (e.g. Allow, Deny,
satisfy the request using a particular input source, et c.). Thus the user has
some control over the capabilities they grant to a requesting origin. Many UAs
will persist the user's decisions, so that the user will not have to make a
decision for subsequent access requests.</p>

<p>Web applications are composable: one web application (the embedder) can embed
others (embedees) by using the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> HTML tag. If a
cross-origin embedee request permissions, it can be problematic from the
perspective of both the user and the embedder. There are 4 reasons for this:</p>

<ol>

<li>People don’t have a good understanding of permission requests from embedees.
There is often no UI in the UA indicating that embedees are present or what
their origin is. They may even be invisible on a page. The concept of composable
applications is not a simple one to convey. The results of a user study
[[iframe-permissions-study]] showed that participants were generally confused
about who they were granting access to when a permission request came from an
embedee.</li>

<li>It’s unclear how a UA should persist the permission decisions people make
for composed applications. Different UAs persist people’s decisions about
embedees in different ways. Some UAs associate the permission grant to the
combination of the embedder’s origin and the embedee’s origin, such that the UA
recalls the decision about the embedee’s permissions only when embedded in that
same embedder. Other UAs associate the grant only to the requesting origin,
regardless of whether and where it is embedded. Either mechanism is likely to
violate people’s expectations, at least some of the time. The inconsistency
across — and even within — UAs further exacerbates the problem.</li>

<li>It’s difficult to build understandable permission management UI. This is
particularly true if UAs persist decisions to a combination of the embedder’s
and embedee’s origin. UI surfaces such as those for revocation and auditing must
cope with displaying two origins in a way that people can understand.</li>

<li>Embedders have no way to regulate access to their embedees. This means that
embedees can behave in ways that reflect badly on the embedder.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>To address these issues, we recommend that UAs require embedders to
explicitly delegate permissions to embedees, rather than allow embeddees to
unilaterally use or request to use powerful features. People would only ever be
required to make permission decisions about the <em>apparent</em> origin of
the application: that of the top-level embedder. The benefits of this, with
relation to the above problems, are:</p>

<ol>

<li>The user does not need to understand the nature of composed applications
because they only ever make decisions about the top-level origin.</li>

<li>It is clear how to persist user decisions: they are only ever stored for the
top-level origin.</li>

<li>Because decisions are only ever made about the top-level origin, it is much
easier to build permission management UI.</li>

<li>Because embedees cannot gain access on their own, embedders are able to
police their embedees.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>Note that there is a necessary trade-off between scoping permission
grants in as fine-grained a manner as possible versus scoping permission
grants at a level of granularity that people can understand. See <a
href="#security-considerations">Security Considerations</a>.</p>

<p>Permission delegation is already possible on the web platform. For
example, if a person has granted geolocation to an origin in a frame, the
origin can expose geolocation data to other, cross-origin frames via
<code>postMessage</code> (among other mechanisms). This document describes a
new web platform API that enables embedders to delegate permissions in a way
that the UA can effectively mediate on behalf of users. In addition to
delegating access, the API also exposes means to revoke and query delegated
access. We intend for the API to be convenient to invoke and to afford
efficient implementations.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Permission Restrictions For Embedded Web Applications</h2>

<p>Before granting a permission to an embedee with a different origin than its
embedder, UAs MUST require that the embedder (a) hold that permission itself;
and (b) explicitly delegate the permission to the embedee using the API described in <a
href="#delegating-permissions">Delegating Permissions</a>.

<p>In cases where an embedder has (yet) delegated a permission, the UA MUST
prevent the embedee from triggering permission prompts to the user, and the UA
SHOULD prevent the embedee from acquiring any permissions based on a prior
decision made by the user.</p>

<p>UAs SHOULD apply these restrictions to all existing and future permissions
defined in the <a>PermissionName enum</a>.</p>

<p>As an exception to the above restrictions, embedees MUST be able to access
permissions that are granted to their associated <a>service worker</a>. These
permissions can be trivially accessed by communicating with the service worker
so there is no need to require delegation.</p>

<p>UAs MAY also allow cross-origin embedees to acquire permission grants through
the use of advanced user configurations, such as custom whitelists (see
<a href="#reduced-user-control">Reduced User Control</a> for further
discussion).</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Delegating Permissions</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways for an embedder to delegate permission grants to an embedee:
A declarative syntax in the HTML tag that instantiates the embedee; and an
imperative syntax that extends the <a>Permissions interface</a>. These are
described below.</p>

<p>To delegate a permission to an embedee, an embedder MUST meet the following
conditions:</p>

<ol>

<li>The embedder and embedee MUST both meet the minimum security requirements to
ask for the permission in the first place. For a <a>powerful feature</a>, such
as <code>getUserMedia</code>, this requires that both embedder and embedee be
running in a <a>privileged context</a>. Not all features require that the
calling origin be in a privileged context or meet other safety standards. But
for those that do, the embedder must meet the requirements before being able to
delegate permission to an embedee, and the embedee must also meet the
requirements.</li>

<li>The embedder itself MUST access to the permission, or must request it of the
user.</li>

</ol>

</p>

<p>The lifetime of the embedees access to the permission MUST be tied to the
lifetime of the embedders access to the permission. That is, the embedee will
only get access to the permission when the embedder has access and will lose
access if the embedder loses access.</p>

<p>Note that an embedder MUST still be able to ask for a permission to be
delegated even before it has access to use the permission itself. In cases like
this, a request to use the permission by the embedee SHOULD trigger an automatic
request to use the permission on behalf of the embedder. This allows embedees to
acquire access to permissions without embedders having to acquire access up
front.</p>

<p>If an embedee performs a cross-origin navigation the permission MUST be
implicitly un-delegated and the embedee will lose access. This prevents
unintentionally delegating access to other origins.</p>

<section>

<h3>Delegation Via The Declarative API</h3>

The permissions attribute is defined on the <a>iframe element</a>.

<pre class='idl'>
partial HTMLIFrameElement : HTMLElement {
  [PutForwards=value] readonly attribute DOMSettableTokenList permissions;
};
</pre>

<p>The permissions attribute, when specified, will delegate the given set of
permissions to the embedee running in the iframe. Its value must be an unordered
set of unique space-separated tokens that are ASCII case-insensitive. The
allowed values are the permission names that come from the <a>PermissionName
enum</a>.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Delegation Via The Imperative API</h3>

<p>The <a>Permissions interface</a> is extended to provide functions for
delegating and undelegating permissions as well as querying the delegation
status.</p>

<pre class='idl'>
  [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
  partial Permissions {
    Promise delegate((PermissionDescriptor or sequence&lt;PermissionDescriptor&gt;) permission);
    Promise undelegate((PermissionDescriptor or sequence&lt;PermissionDescriptor&gt;) permission);
    Promise&lt;boolean&gt; isDelegated(PermissionDescriptor permission);
  };
</pre>

<p>When called with these functions <a>PermissionDescriptor</a> must contain a
field which specifies the embedee:</p>

<dl class='idl' title='dictionary PermissionDescriptor'>
<dt>required PermissionName <a>name</a></dt>
<dt>HTMLIframeElement embedee</dt>
</dl>

<p>The embedee specified must be nested in the caller’s browsing context
otherwise the request for delegation will be rejected.</p>

<p>Calling delegate will cause the given permissions to be delegated to their
embedees. The promise returned will resolve if the permission is successfully
delegated, otherwise it will be rejected. Similarly, undelegate will cause the
given permissions to no longer be delegated to the embedees.</p>

<p>The isDelegated function returns a promise which will resolve to true if the
permission is delegated to the given frame or to false otherwise.</p>

</section>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Consider an embedder https://restaurant.example.net whose developers want to
show a map on the page that enables people to get directions to the restaurant.
They can do so by instantiating an iframe to the maps service
https://maps.example.com, and by explicitly delegating the
<var>geolocation</var> permission:

<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/" permissions="geolocation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

<p>Consider next that the developers of https://restaurant.example.net learn of
a new feature that https://maps.example.com provides, which is to send people
notifications [[notifications]] when it’s time to leave to get to their
destination on time. For example, people may want to know not just the
directions to the restaurant, but also to be notified when they should leave to
make it by the time their reservation starts. The developers would explicitly
grant the embedded iframe a second permission, <var>notifications</var>:</p>

<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/" permissions="geolocation notifications"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

Delegation via the imperative API:

<pre class='example highlight'>
var iframe = document.getElementById('embedee');
navigator.permissions.delegate({embedee: iframe, name: 'geolocation'}).then(
  function() {
    // Delegated geolocation.
  }).catch(function() {
    // Delegation failed.
  });
</pre>

Undelegating permissions:

<pre class='example highlight'>
var iframe = document.getElementById('embedee');
navigator.permissions.undelegate({embedee: iframe, name: 'geolocation'});
</pre>

Checking whether permission is delegated:

<pre class='example highlight'>
var iframe = document.getElementById('embedee');
navigator.permissions.isDelegated({embedee: iframe, name: 'geolocation'})
  .then(function(result) {
    // result === true
  });
</pre>

</section>

<section class='informative'>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

<p>The most obvious downside of this proposal is that it breaks the principle of
least privilege. In particular, an embedee can’t get access to a permission
without the top-level embedder also getting access to the permission. Thus, the
permission grant is broader than is strictly necessary.</p>

<p>For example, consider an airline ticketing site (https://example.air) that
embeds a payment processor site (https://example.cc) in an iframe. To better
authenticate or verify the purchase of tickets, example.cc requests access to
the UA's geolocation API. Under this proposal, the user would have to grant
geolocation API access to the example.air origin, which would then delegate the
power to example.cc. The grant would adhere, perhaps persistently, to
example.air — regardless of what other origins it may embed — rather than to
example.cc.</p>

<p>We could extend this scenario to a potentially more problematic case in which
a less trustworthy site (https://example.suspicious) also allows purchases and
embeds an example.cc frame for credit card verification. Now the user has to
give access to their location to example.suspicious as well as to example.cc to
complete their purchase. Obviously, this is not ideal.</p>

<p>Conversely, if embedees can directly request access to powerful features
(currently the case in many UAs), people may not understand where the request
comes from — although example.air is a composed application, people are often
unaware that web applications can be composed of an embedder and potentially
several embedees. Thus, when an embedee requests a permission grant, the person
may not have any context for or understanding of what the UA is asking them. We
believe that people perceive the top-level site as the ‘active application’ — if
they perceive any ‘active application’ at all. Thus, we believe that if there is
any chance for an origin to be or provide context for a permission request, it
is the top-level, embedder origin.</p>

<p>Additionally, embedees can take advantage of this confusion, and request
permissions (or otherwise cost the person’s attention) in ways that disrupt the
trust relationship between the person and the top-level embedder origin.</p>

<p>This proposal puts the onus on the embedder, which has chosen to embed its
embedees, to state the value proposition for the permission grant and to
establish a relationship with the person using the application. It also enables
and incentivizes embedders to ‘police’ their embedees in order to remain
trustworthy.</p>

</section>

<section class='informative'>

<h2>Other Risks</h2>

<section>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>This document specifies breaking changes to the web platform. Namely,
embedees that were once able to request and acquire permissions will no longer
be able to do so. In order to restore functionality, embedders need to change
their iframe tags to specify which permissions they wish to delegate. Usage of
permissions from embedees is currently very low (see
[[iframe-permissions-chrome]]), so the impact of this change should be small. It
is recommended that UAs communicate this change with developers prior to
implemenation in order to minimize the impact of the change. This can be done
through the use of console warning messages or other channels.</p>

<p>The upside of this breakage is that any harmful or annoying permission
requests from embedees, which website owners did not intend their users to be
exposed to will be prevented.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the restrictions specified in this document
would prevent secure (HTTPS) embedees in non-secure (HTTP) embedders from
getting access to permissions. The reason is that the availability of “powerful
features” on non-secure origins is being phased out (see [[powerful-features]]).
This means that a top-level embedder would never be able to access a
permission in order to delegate it. This is actually not more restrictive than
what is specified in [[powerful-features]], which requires all ancestor frames
be secure in order for a frame to be considered secure. The restrictions
specified in this document would not result in additional breakages.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Changing Embedee Permissions</h3>

<p>iframe tags tend to be fairly widely copy/pasted. For example, to make it
easy for developers to embed YouTube videos, YouTube provides a HTML iframe
snippet which can be pasted into a website. Once these snippets have been
deployed, it is hard for embedees to have them changed. For example, if the
permissions required to run YouTube ever changed, it would be impossible for
YouTube to update all of its embedders. While this may be problematic for
embedees, it gives embedders an opportunity to decide whether they really want
the embedee to have access to the permission.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>Reduced User Control</h3>

<p>Some people may want to be able to let an embed<em>ee</em> origin they
consider trustworthy have access to some permissions, but may not want to grant
those same permissions to an embedd<em>er</em> they consider untrustworthy. <a
href="#security-considerations">Permission grants adhere to the
embedder</a>, which presents a paradox of control: it seems we can present
people an option to control permissions at a coarse but understandable
granularity; or we can present an option to control permissions at a fine but
confusing granularity. (See <a href="#background-and-motivations">Background And
Motivations</a>.)</p>

<p>UAs may provide advanced configuration options to mitigate this risk. These
options would place more control back into the hands of users. For example, a
user-controlled whitelist could be used to allow embedees from certain origins
to get permission access without delegation. Alternatively, UAs may have an
option which allows embedees to independently prompt a user for permission but
the decision is not persisted by default. This proposal does not recommend or
require any specific mitigation techniques.</p>

<p>Composing origins to create more complex web applications is analogous to
application composition from components of different sources on other platforms,
and other platforms also tie the principal to just the top-level application.
(For a definition of the term <em>principal</em>, see
[[protection-of-information]]).</p>

<ul>

<li>Many Android applications include libraries (often packaged as JARs) from
third parties, but the Android platform treats the embedding package as the
principal, and adheres permission grants to that package. Consider an email
reader, com.example.mail, that includes an IMAP client implemented in a JAR
provided by the Foo Organization, that provides the package org.foo.imap.client.
Android exposes only com.example.mail to the user, gives it a unique Linux UID,
and all permission grants and revocations adhere to com.example.mail. If another
package, e.g. org.messaging.android, also happens to use the org.foo.imap.client
JAR, the JAR does not have the same permissions in both embedding packages.</li>

<li>Many Windows applications include libraries (often packaged as DLLs) from
third parties. Similar to the Android example, Windows separates privileges by
associating each process with an access token. Processes holding different
tokens are protected from each other, regardless of what DLLs they have loaded
(even if they have loaded some of the same DLLs) and regardless of the source of
those DLLs.</li>

</ul>

<p>Neither the Android nor Windows platforms afford the user any fine-grained
control over the permissions available to code that ‘top-level’ applications
depend on. This proposal for the Open Web Platform is consistent with the
existing, analogous behavior on other platforms. Reasonable people may disagree
on whether or not that is a good thing, but advocates for fine-grained control
of dependencies must contend with the problems of user confusion, lack of
context, and warning fatigue that fine-grained control would raise, and has
proven to raise. TODO(palmer): Get a cite from felt or ainslie on reduced
responsiveness to warnings.</p>
